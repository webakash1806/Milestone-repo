# Project 2

# Simple Movie Search Web App

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Movie Search Web App project! This is a web application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for movies using an input box. Upon receiving the user's input, the application fetches movie data from the OMDB API and displays the relevant movie details.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a movie search application that provides the following functionalities:

1. **User Interface**:
   - Build a simple and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

2. **Fetching Movie Data**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and fetch movie data from the OMDB API based on the user's input query.

3. **Display Movie Details**:
   - Display the fetched movie details, such as the movie title and poster image, on the application interface.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handle edge cases, such as when a movie is not found or the user provides invalid input.

## Requirements

To run this project successfully, you need the following:

- A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or similar).
- An internet connection to access the OMDB API.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for editing the project files.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. **Register on OMDB API Website**: Visit the [OMDB API website](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to obtain your API key. The API key will be required to make requests to the OMDB API.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-app
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd movie-search-app
   ```

4. **Open the Project**: Use your code editor to open the project folder.

5. **Explore the Files**: Familiarize yourself with the project files. You will find an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`) that make up the Simple Movie Search Web App.

## Usage

To use the Simple Movie Search Web App:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. You will see the user interface with an input box where you can enter the name of the movie you want to search for.

3. Enter the movie name and press Enter or click the "Search" button.

4. The application will fetch movie data from the OMDB API and display the relevant movie details, including the movie title and poster image, on the page.

5. If the movie is not found or the user provides invalid input, the application will handle these cases gracefully and display an appropriate message.
